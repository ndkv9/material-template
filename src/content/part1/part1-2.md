In the previous section, we introduced our first **variable**, the **string variable**. String is not the only variable in coding. Variables are the basic storages of information in coding. Variables are for example the familiar **string** for text, but also **int** for integers, **double** for numbers with decimal numbers, or **boolean** for truth value. As mentioned earlier, the value for a variable is set with **the equals sign, =**.

```cpp
int truth = 42;
```

In the example above we **declare** a variable called **truth** and **assign** it the **value** **42**.

This integer can be concatenated to a string in our program.

```cpp
int truth = 42;
double pie = 3.141592653;
bool valid = true;
string magic = "The magic number: ";
Console.WriteLine(magic + truth);
Console.WriteLine("Life of " + pie);
Console.WriteLine("This is awesome: " + valid);
```

Produces the following when ran

```console
The magic number: 42
Life of 3.141592653
This is awesome: true
```

The variable names must be unique inside a code block. You can declare each variable only once. But, as the name **variable** suggests, you can change their value.

```cpp
int number = 42;
Console.WriteLine(number);
number = 21;
Console.WriteLine(number);
```

Prints

```console
42
21
```

## Assigning value to a variable

Let us take a closer look of our previous example.

```cpp
int number = 42;
Console.WriteLine(number);
number = 21;
Console.WriteLine(number);
```

Prints

```console
42
21
```

In the first line, we declare the variable and assign it a value. With this information, the compiler creates the **int** variable and stores the value.

In the second line, we use the variable to access the stored information. It could be said that the variable name is a reference to the value. Once we have gained the value, the command prints it as requested.

Earlier it was mentioned, that you can declare a variable only once. This time we do not declare the value. The difference is the **int** on the first line. As we did on the second line while we printed the value, on the third line we once again reference to the number, rather than declare it again. With the **equals sign** we **assign a new value** to the variable.

## Variable typing

The variables in **C#** are statically typed. This means that once a variable is declared into a certain type, the type does not change\*.

\* There is nowadays a keyword **dynamic** in C#, but that is not relevant for basic coding. For our purposes, we treat C# with static typing.

For example, this works:

```cpp
int magic = 42;
magic = 41;
```

This does not:

```cpp
int magic = 42;
magic = "Magic";
```

There are exceptions, of course. For example, you can assign an integer to a double:

```cpp
double decimal = 10; // Works fine

int number = 20;
decimal = number; // Also works
```

... but not the other way around:

```cpp
int number = 4.2; // Does not work

double decimal = 4.2;
number = decimal // Does not work either
```

## Naming variables

Previously we discussed about the quality of code, and its readibility. Consider the following examples:

```cpp
double a = 3.14;
double b = 22.0;
double c = a * b * b;

Console.WriteLine(c);
```

Prints

```console
1519.76
```

```cpp
double pi = 3.14;
double radius = 22.0;
double area = pi * radius * radius;

Console.WriteLine(area);
```

Prints

```console
1519.76
```

They both produce the same result. How ever, the second one is much easier to read, and its functionality is easier to understand. Both codes calculate the area of a circle. First we define the value of pi, then the radius, and finally we calculate the area.

There are certain restrictions to naming variables, as well as conventions. The variable names...

- cannot contain special characters, such as **!**, **?**, **รฅ** or **รถ**
- cannot contain empty spaces, also called **whitespace**
- start with a **lowercase letter**
- shouldBeWrittenInCamelCase

The variables in C# are usually written with [**camelCase (here)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case). This means the variable name starts with a small letter, contains no other characters than letters and numbers and contains no punctuation or spaces.

Even though **snake_case** with underscore would be a valid variable name, such naming convention is not recommended, and should **not** be used during this course.

```cpp
int 9var = 42; // Does not work
int var9 = 42; // Works, but does not describe the variable well
```

The variables can only be declared once:

```cpp
string camelCase = "Camels are fun!";
string camelCase = "Camels are nice"; // Does not compile, the variable name is already in use
```

## Reading different kinds of variables from user

In the previous part we learned how to read a **string variable** from the user.

```cpp
public class Program
{
   public static void Main()
   {
      Console.Write("Give a message: ");
      string message = Console.ReadLine();
      Console.WriteLine(message);
   }
}
```

```console
Give a message: I want to print this
I want to print this
```

All the other variables, such as integers, doubles or booleans are also read from the user as strings. We have to convert them to the correct type with built in methods.

```cpp
Console.Write("Give integer value: ");

// Declare and assign the input as string
string userInput = Console.ReadLine();

// Convert string to integer type
int intValue = Convert.ToInt32(userInput);

Console.WriteLine("You gave " + intValue);

Console.Write("Give double value: ");

// Assign new value to userInput
userInput = Console.ReadLine();

// Convert string to double type
double doubleValue = Convert.ToDouble(userInput);

Console.WriteLine("You gave " + doubleValue);
```

This would print

```console
Give integer value: 42
You gave: 42
Give double value: 4.2
You gave: 4.2
```

In the example above, we read both an integer and a double. As you can see, there is no large difference between the methods, only the method name is different, from the coding point of view.

If we want to convert a truth value from a string, are two options: **True** and **False**.

```cpp
string truth = "True";
bool booleanValue = System.Convert.ToBoolean(truth);
Console.WriteLine(booleanValue);

truth = "False";
booleanValue = System.Convert.ToBoolean(truth);
Console.WriteLine(booleanValue);
```

Gives us

```console
True
False
```

The **Convert Class** can be used to convert strings into multiple other types as well. We will handle them as they come, but for the curious, the full list can be [**found here**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.convert?view=netframework-4.8).

# Exercises

<Exercise title={'011 Print variables'}>

The exercise comes with a template that prints the following:

```console
Days to summer:
100
Hours to lunch:
1
Coding is fun:
Are you sure?
```

Change the `values` of the variables, so the program will print

```console
Days to summer:
200
Hours to lunch:
3.5
Coding is fun:
It sure is!
```

Do not change anything else, only the variable values!

</Exercise>

<Exercise title={'012 Print integer'}>

Create a program which asks the user for an `integer`. After user input, the program will print the `integer`. Example prints:

```console
Give a number!
> 11
You gave 11
```

```console
Give a number!
> 42
You gave 42
```

<Note>Use WriteLine for prints, not just Write! </Note>

</Exercise>

<Exercise title={'013 Print double'}>

Create a program, that asks the user for a `double`. After user input, the program will print the `double`. Example prints:

```console
Give a number!
> 11.11
You gave 11.11
```

```console
Give a number!
> 41.999999
You gave 41.999999
```

</Exercise>

<Exercise title={'014 Print truth'}>

Create a program, that asks the user for a `boolean`. After user input, the program will print the `boolean`. Example prints:

False
```

</Exercise>

<Exercise title={'015 Asking multiple inputs'}>

Let's combine everything you know so far. create program that asks the user for a string, an integer, a double and a boolean, and prints them like follows:

```console
Give a string:
> This is a masterpiece!
Give an integer:
> 42
Give a double:
> 3.1415
Give a boolean:
> True
Your string: This is a masterpiece!
Your integer: 42
Your double: 3.1415
Your boolean: True
```
