<Note>
The part of "Running the source code" does not unfortunately work yet.

We have to run our exercises manually, if we want to do so.
</Note>

## Running the exercises

In Visual Studio Code, select `Terminal` and then `New Terminal`

![Terminal menu](https://github.com/centria/basic-csharp/raw/master/src/images/new-terminal.png)

A selection of options will pop up. The selections contain all the open exercises. In the example, I am doing part 6, so I have those open.

![Folder selection](https://github.com/centria/basic-csharp/raw/master/src/images/select-folder.png)

* Select the exercise you are doing
* A new terminal opens at the bottom of Visual Studio Code.

* write the command `cd/Exercise000` , but instead of the zeros, use the actual exercise number. Press `Enter`.

![Selecting source folder](https://github.com/centria/basic-csharp/raw/master/src/images/exercise003.png)

* In the example, I am doing exercise 003 of the part, so my command is `cd/Exercise003`
* Now you are in the actual exercise folder, and can run the program.
* Run the program with the command `dotnet run`. 

![Dotnet run](https://github.com/centria/basic-csharp/raw/master/src/images/dotnet-run.png)

* If your program works as it should, you can see the output in the console. The next example is from Part 6, exercise 003:

![Dotnet run](https://github.com/centria/basic-csharp/raw/master/src/images/dotnet-print.png)

<Note>The dollar sign in the pictures is NOT part of the command! </Note>

### Alternative way

In Visual Studio Code,
* Click on the exerice folder with right mouse button, and choose `Open in integrated terminal`.
* Run the program with the command `dotnet run`.
